tkmoo-ttk is a fork of tkmoo-light < http://www.awns.com/tkMOO-light > with
some additions from tkmoo-se < http://sourceforge.net/projects/tkmoo-se/ >.  It
attempts to update most of the UI elements to the ttk widget set so they look
and act like it's 2002 instead of 1995.  Baby steps, right?

I've added in tkmoo-SE's giant collection of approximately every plugin ever,
and started a couple new ones of my own.  In general, this is borrowed and
plundered from several sources, often second- or third- hand.  I hope to
document this better as I pare it down to what will eventually actually be part
of it.

There are some known issues, and like all forks of tkmoo-light, it had a giant
flurry of activity once and since then is basically unmaintained.  You're
welcome to use it, and pull requests are encouraged.  Bug reports are certainly
welcome, but the vicissitudes of my attention mean there's no guarantee of me
fixing them.  Can't hurt to ask, though.

Licensing is murky:  tkMOO-light was released under a fairly lenient license,
but with commercial-use prohibition.  tkMOO-SE was released under the GPL,
which might not be compatible with the original license.  I've included each
one here, in order to muddle the situation even further.
